## Introduction

Kotlin is a modern programming language that supports multiple paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming. This repository aims to illustrate how to leverage these paradigms effectively, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their projects.

## Features

- **Multi-Paradigm Support**: Demonstrates how to use Kotlin in different programming styles.
- **Clear Examples**: Provides straightforward code examples for easy understanding.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed explanations of each paradigm and its use cases.
- **Community Contributions**: Encourages developers to contribute and share their knowledge.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Kotlin installed on your machine. You can download Kotlin from the [official website](https://kotlinlang.org/).

### Prerequisites

- JDK 8 or higher
- Kotlin Compiler
- An IDE that supports Kotlin (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/optechhub/kotlin-multi-paradigm-iteration.git
cd kotlin-multi-paradigm-iteration
```

## Usage

After cloning the repository, you can explore the different examples provided. Each example demonstrates a specific paradigm and how to implement it in Kotlin.

To run a specific example, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the following command:

```bash
kotlinc <example_file>.kt -include-runtime -d <output_file>.jar
java -jar <output_file>.jar
```

## Examples

### Object-Oriented Programming

In the object-oriented section, you will find examples that demonstrate the use of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism in Kotlin.

```kotlin
open class Animal {
    open fun makeSound() {
        println("Some sound")
    }
}

class Dog : Animal() {
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("Bark")
    }
}
```

### Functional Programming

The functional programming section showcases how to use higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and immutability.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }
    println(doubled)
}
```

### Procedural Programming

Here, you will see examples that focus on the procedural style, emphasizing the use of functions and sequential execution.

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String) {
    println("Hello, $name!")
}

fun main() {
    greet("World")
}
```
